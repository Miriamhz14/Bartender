### Techniques
Additional npm packages used for my project are fetch. This is used as a way to 
get information and fetch can accept two parameters.  To run this I just did it the same way
we do everything else, npm ---save install fetch.

---
Some problems I encounter during the project were adding data from API to my table.This was the 
hardest thing to do in my opnion. I also had to switch ideas mutiple times because I would realize 
half way that the API was hard to work with so I didn't commit at all. 

---
Encounter many problems with my routes but was able to get help from classmates who explained
very well what to do.

---
NPMs used express, PG-Promise, Body-Parser, Method-Override, Mustache-Express, and Fetch
